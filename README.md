# COVID-19 World Map
This project was my second project incorporating ReactJS for creating a web application. This was a capstone project for a rapid prototyping course at Washington University in St. Louis. I took inspiration from the quarantine that was ongoing at the time of the assignment, as well as finding the perfect API, [Disease.sh].


[Disease.sh]: <https://disease.sh/>


## Learning Outcomes
Some of the large takeaways from this project were:
- Modularization through React Components
- Asynchronous calls to an API endpoint
- Creating a function for manipulating data to size circles in a manner where they don't explode
